# Call-of-Duty-rcon-admin
The codRconAdmin.exe is a Windows Forms application that, upon opening, launches 
a console application called cod4RconProgramC.exe. It is crucial for the console 
application to remain open for proper functionality. The Windows Forms application 
communicates with the console application using inputsimulator to send commands.

To connect to your Call of Duty server, fill in the IP, PORT, and rcon password fields. 
Afterward, you can send commands to your server by entering them into the 
command field and pressing send.
